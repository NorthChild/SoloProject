- DAY 1 

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			MVP UI ready - Logic linked to UI - Logic Implemented in Business layer

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			Spent more time than wanted on UI due to issues with linking logic with UI

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			Having some delays in linking the UI to the app logic, as a contingency, i switched to another task among the prioritised ones, this gave me the ability to continue with the requirements without dwelling on a roadblock, until either i manage to get insight from a team member, or return with a fresher mindset ready to solve the issue.

- DAY 2

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			Switch between windows via button press, display progress results in new window, clear user stories, gherkins, tests

  - ISSUES:

    ​			No issues to report

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			No items in backlog

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			Managed to deliver MVP to its base requirements, have been added functionality to the app by Product Owner, it will require an additional window, DB adaptation as well as extension from the original app logic

- DAY 3

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			Create and Link DB using EF, start tests on db, register new user and save it to db

  - ISSUES:

    ​			Some technical issues with some of the Nunit package slowed down the creation of DB tests

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			 Tests in sprint backlog due to technical issue with IDE

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			Managed to complete a good portion of the remaining tasks as well as completing some User stories and Tests on the DB, finding moving between tasks when confronted by a roadblock very useful.

- DAY 4

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			Login page, functional and tested, DB tests added and functional, subskill UI done

  - ISSUES:

    ​			Found problem with main classes design, need to invest time into fixing the issue

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			 Managed to pull many items from backlog after fixing the obj design issue

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			The roadblock that manifested today gave me an opportunity to realise how many things i would do differently were i to start this project anew, contingencies like changing to another task when blocked, as helped push the project forward even when i was blocked on another aspect, coming back to it after clearing tasks and having a fresh approach helped with resolving the issue and move forward

- DAY 5

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			Implement User Skill list, implement crud on skill view

  - ISSUES:

    ​			Had some trouble completing some user stories, small roadblock that will probably be overcome with next sprint

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			 Managed to implement skill report view, couple items in backlog, to be completed by end of next sprint

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			Another road-block that showed me what i would have changed were i to start again with the project, i've learned many new tricks into being more efficient while building up a task by task

- DAY 6

  - SPRINT GOALS:

    ​			implement update and delete on WPF, implement subskills to DB

  - ISSUES:

    ​			Tried implementing extra functionality but preferred to avoid since i would have to radically change the db objects, therefore task details have been left in backlog

  - SPRINT REVIEW:

    ​			 Managed to implement all crud elements, decided to avoid using the Update element since it wasnt relevant with the application aim and functionality, regardless, built the Update methods as well as tested its functionality via unitesting the db and update method, didnt manage to implement subskill feature, placed it in backlog.

  - RETROSPECTIVES:

    ​			After the project end i have learned a lot on how to structure the project and how to proceed, i made some decisions at the start of the project that dictated my progress, and if i were to go back i would approach the whole process in a very different manner
